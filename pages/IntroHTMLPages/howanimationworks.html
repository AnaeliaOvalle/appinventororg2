		<p>In App Inventor, one can animate objects on a Canvas Component,
			but to understand how to do that, one must understand animation.</p>

			Animation is an optical illusion. This flipbook is displaying of a
			series of images quickly that makes it look like the images are
			moving.<br> To measure any movement you need two things -
			Velocity (how far is moved) and Time (the time it takes for the
			movement). So there are two things needed: A series of images and the
			time it takes to switch between images.

		<p>Think of cars. In the U.S., a car's speed is measured in MPH or
			miles per hour. 10 miles per hour means it will take 1 hour to travel
			10 miles, 100 miles per hour means it will take 1 hour to travel 100
			miles.</p>
		<img width="50%" class="img-responsive center-img" alt="img0"

		<p>In animation and film, instead of using MPH they use FPS:
			frames per second or frames/seconds. In the flipbook gif above, what
			are the frames?</p>

		<h2>Smooth vs Laggy Animation</h2>
		<p>
			Currently, Youtube allows people to change the speed of videos on their website.
			Check out the stop motion video below and play it at all 6 speeds by clicking the gear icon on the bottom right of the video.
			Stop motion videos are created by putting a series of pictures
			together to make a video.<br> <img class="img-responsive center-img"

		<p>What do you notice about animation smoothness between slow and
			fast speeds?</p>

		<p>As you can probably tell, the faster the speed, the smoother
			the animation.</p>
