		<p>In App Inventor, one can animate objects on a canvas, but to
			understand how to do that, one must understand animation.</p>

			Animation is an optical illusion. This flipbook is displaying of a
			series of images quickly that makes it look like the images are
			moving.<br> To measure any movement you need two things -
			Velocity (how far is moved) and Time (the time it takes for the
			movement). So there are two things needed: A series of Images and
			time it takes to switch between images.

		<p>Think of cars. In the US a car's speed is measured in MPH or
			Miles per Hour. 10 miles per hour means it will take 1 hour to travel
			10 miles, 100 miles per hour means it will take 1 hour to travel 100
			miles.</p>

		<p>In animation and film, instead of using MPH they use FPS:
			Frames per second or Frames/Second. In the flipbook Gif above, what
			does are the Frames, and what are the seconds?</p>

		<h2>Smooth vs Laggy Animation</h2>
		<p>Currently, Youtube allows people to change the speed of their videos. Check out the stop motion video below and play it at all 6 speeds. Stop motion videos are created by putting a series of pictures together to make a video.

		<p>What do you notice about animation smoothness between slow and fast speeds?</p>

	<p>As you can probably tell, the faster the speed, the smoother the animation.</p>
