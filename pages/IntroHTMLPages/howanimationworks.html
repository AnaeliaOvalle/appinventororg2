			Animation is an optical illusion. The flipbook above is displaying a
			series of pages quickly so that, to the naked eye, the images are
			moving. 
		</p>

	

		<p>When we drive, we think of speed in terms of miles per hour (MPH). In animation and film, 
		frames per second (FPS) is used instead, where a "frame" is each page in the flipbook. </p>

		<h2>Smooth vs Laggy Animation</h2>
		<p>
			To get a feel for how frames per second can be used to control an animation, play the stop 
			motion video below at different speeds by clicking the gear icon 
			on the bottom right of the video, choosing "Speed", and selecting various settings.

		<h2>Animation in App Inventor using the Clock Component</h2>
		<p>In App Inventor, you can use the Clock component and its Clock.Timer event
		to facilitate animation. For instance, the following blocks cause a ball to move
		to the right every second:

"> 




					<img class="img-responsive" alt="img0"
						src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/A_SB.gif">


		<p>Notice that the ball is slow and lags. This is because the Clock.Timer
		event triggers every 1000 milliseconds by default. You can change the Clock.TimerInterval
		to make an animation faster or slower-- this is how you control the frames per second.</p>		

	

		<p>For instance, if we changed the TimerInterval in the Clockâ€™s properties to 10
			ms instead of 1000 ms, we'd get a faster ball movement:</p>

					<p>Now the ball moves smoothly across the screen because it is moving 1 pixel every 10 ms.</p>

	<p>What is the frames per second (FPS) of the animation if the Clock.TimerInterval is set to 10 ms.</p>
   	<div class="quiz-panel-inner">
			<div id="q6a" class="collapse">

			<p> The Clock.Timer event will trigger every 10 ms. 10 ms is 1/100 of a second, so this means the Clock.Timer
				event will trigger 100 times a second. Thus the FPS is 100.
