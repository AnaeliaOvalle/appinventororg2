		<h2>Topics</h2>
		<p>App Inventor environment, events, event-handlers, components, properties, conditionals</p>

		<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>App Inventor has two main windows. What are they and what do you do with them?</li>
			<li>Testing and Installing an App</li>
			<ul>
				<li>How do you test an app while you're developing it?</li>
				<li>How can you install an app you build to your phone?</li>
				<li>What if you didn't have a phone, but wanted to program some apps. Could you? How?</li>

			</ul>
			
			<li>For the I Have a Dream app, name a:</li>
	
					<ul>

						<li>visible component:</li>
						<li>non-visible component:</li>
						<li>property</li>
						<li>event</li>
						<li>event-handler</li>
						<li>function call</li>
						<li>conditional</li>
					</ul>

			<li>What is an event handler? What does it consist of?</li>

			<li>An app consists of its user interface and its behavior. What does an app’s behavior consist of?</li>

		</ol>

		<h2>Customization Exercises</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Modify the “I Have a Dream” app so that the MLK speech starts when you shake the phone. You’ll need an AccelerometerSensor component. Explore on your own and see if you can figure it out. If you get stuck, see http://www.appinventor.org/Events#shaking.</li>
			<li>The “I Have a Dream” app uses two Player Components, one for each speech. Rewrite the app so that only a single Player Component is used (hint: you’ll need to change the Player.Source property in the blocks).</li>
