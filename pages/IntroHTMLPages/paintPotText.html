	<h1>Getting the Components</h1>
	<h4>Now that we know which components we need, we need to drag them in and rename them and get them to look just how we want.</h4>
	<hr>
	<h4>Start by dragging in your canvas component. 
Notice that it starts out very small, How are you going to be able to draw something on that 
small? Lets change its width property to fill parent (or however big the screen is) and make the height 300 pixels. </h4>

		<h4>Then drag in you buttons. Remember to change their text and to rename each component to what they do. For example: Rename Button1 to RedButton. Rename Button3 to TakePictureButton.
Be sure to use Horizontal Arrangement component under the Layout Tab to get things next to each other.
Save a version as before you move on. </h4>
