		<p>
			The Canvas component is a two-dimensional, touch-sensitive
			rectangular panel that can be drawn on and can animate images
			(sprites). <br> <br> Think of the Canvas as a piece of
			paper taking space in our app. <br> It can be drawn on and
			allows things to move on their own (animation).
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			To be able to code things to happen on the Canvas, we need to be able
			to <b>identify spots on the Canvas </b> because we need to be able to
			tell the app <b>where </b> things should move. <br> </p>
			<p>A Canvas is really a grid of pixels, where a pixel is the tiniest possible dot of color that can 
			appear on the screen. Each pixel’s location is de„fined by x-y coordinates on a grid system. In this coordinate system, 
			x de„fines a location on the horizontal plane (starting at 0 on the far left and increasing as you move to the right across the screen),
			 and y de„fines a location on the vertical plane (starting at 0 at the top and increasing as you move down the screen).
The top-left cell in a Canvas starts with 0 for both coordinates, so this position is represented as (x=0,y=0). As you move right, 
the x coordinate increases; as you move down, the y coordinate increases. The upper-right corner has an x coordinate equal to the width 
of the Canvas minus 1. This is different than the traditional cooridinate system, as you can see in the figure below. </p>
