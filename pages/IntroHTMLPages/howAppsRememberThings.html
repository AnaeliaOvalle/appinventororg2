		<h4>An app remembers things, it has &quot;hidden&quot; memory. 
		Think of it like a spreadsheet of data in the app&apos;s private &quot;brain&quot;. You, the programmer, control the memory - 
		what should be remembered and when to remember it. When you drag a component (e.g., button, text box) into your app, a 
		set of properties are remembered, by being named, and stored. These properties are &quot;spreadsheet&quot; cells that you can change.</h4>

	<div class="card">
	<h2>For Example</h2>
		<h4>Look at the properties for a Button1. 
		Each property is named, has a value, and we can ask the app to tell us each property&apos;s value. </h4>
