		<h2>Getting a Mole to Appear</h2>
		<p>To begin, Create a new project and drag in a canvas (under
			Drawing and Animation). The Canvas component always comes in way too
			small, so lets change its width property to fill parent and its
			height property to 300 pixels.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Now that we have the place where our Mole is supposed to
			appear and disappear, let's get a mole on the Canvas. The component
			you should use for this is the Image Sprite component (also found
			under Drawing and Animation).</p>


		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MMT_imagepsrite.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">

		<p>If you test your app after dragging in the image sprite, you
			will not see an image sprite because there is no image for your mole.
			Upload a (small) image into your app and set your imagesprite1
			picture to the image in the properties in the designer. If the
			picture is too big, either resize it using your computer software, or
			change the imagesprite size properties (width and height) to be a
			small square (ex 30 x30).</p>

				<p>The mole should move to a random point on the canvas.</p>

	<div class="card">
		<h2>Fit within Canvas Height and Width</h2>
		<p>Here, the bug is that the mole can be part way off of the
			screen, and not be able to be tapped. The reason for this is that
			when you have an image, the image’s (x,y) position is that of the top
			left corner.</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_ISS.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">
		<p>So instead of having the mole’s X go to a random number
			within the entire canvas width, how far should the mole’s X go? Use
			the picture below to help. Hint - What is the farthest X point that
			we want the mole to be able to go.</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_ISW.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">
		<p>Canvas width - mole width = the farthest position that we
			want the mole to go.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>What about height?</p>

		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_ISH.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">

		<p>So in the end you want the mole X to move from 1 to the
			canvas width - mole width and the mole Y to move from 1 to the the
			Canvas Height - The Mole height every time the clock timer goes off.</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_MB.png"

	<div class="card" id="score">
		<h2>Showing Score and the ScoreLabel</h2>
		<p>For this part of the task we need to get a place on our
			screen that shows the user their score.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_Score.png"

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_ScoreC.png"
					class="img-responsive center-img">
			</div>

		</div>

		<p>In the above example, there are 2 labels inside of a
			horizontal arrangement. One label that displays the text “Score:” and
			the other “0” that displays the actual score. The label showing “0”
			was renamed to score label so that when one codes they know which
			label should be added to.</p>


	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<h2>Make it so that the user can get a point tapping the mole and
			the phone vibrates.</h2>
		<p>Now that we have the label that will show the score, we can
			start to code what happens when the mole is touched.</p>
		<p>Mole.Touched is the event that happens when the mole is
			touched on the canvas.</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_Touched.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">
		<p>Now that we know the event handler, what do we want to do
			when the mole is touched.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Gain a point</p></li>
			<li><p>Make the phone vibrate</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Gain A Point</b>
		</p>
		<p>Which component shows the user their current score? Look at
			your Designer if you’ve forgotten.</p>

		<p>
			<b>ScoreLabel</b>
		</p>
		<p>So when Mole is touched we want the ScoreLabel to increase by
			one.</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_TouchedInc.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">




		<p>
			<b>Vibrate</b>
		</p>
		<p>Which component causes the phone to vibrate?</p>
		<br>
		<p>The Sound Component</p>
		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_SC.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">
		<p>Now we also want the sound to vibrate after a pint is gained.</p>

	<div class="card" id="timer">
		<h2>Countdown timer</h2>
		<p>A countdown timer is simply a label that decreases by one
			every second and it ends a game when it reaches 0. Similar to how you
			gain a point except it will use an event that repeats in a loop and
			it will subtract.</p>
		<p>First we need the label that will show time so that the user
			can see how much time is left.</p>

		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_SandT.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img"> <img alt=""
			src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_HAComp.png"
			class="img-responsive center-img">

		<p>Notice that it has been done similarly to score, where there
			are two labels, one identifying that it is how much time is let, and
			another that is the actual number, or value, for how much time is
			left, and that the components are renamed so that when we are coding
			we can know which label we are talking about.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Next we need a component that will make our TimerLabel
			decrease by one every interval of time, Which component should be
			used?</p>

		<img alt="" src="/images/CourseInABoxImages/MM_CTC.png"

		<p>Now that we have our clock we just need it to decrease the
