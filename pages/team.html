					<h2>Thomas Oropeza</h2>
					<p>My life revolves around technology. I am deeply interested
						and fascinated by it. I enjoy learning and understanding the way
						computers function. I program as a hobby and find the creative
						developmental process of finishing software exciting. The ability
						to have complete control over software is what I love about
						programming because it makes whatever I create an extension of my
						creativity. I am currently studying at University of San Francisco
						to explore the limitless amount of different ways that Computer
						Science can help me develop whatever my creativity can come up
						with.</p>
