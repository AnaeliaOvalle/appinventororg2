<p>The <i>App Inventor Java Bridge</i> is a Java library for building Android apps. It has a much easier learning curve than 
the Android SDK, which is the library commonly used in Android development. The Java Bridge has an added advantage for 
those who have programmed in App Inventor, as the terminology is the same: there is a Java class pertaining to 
each App Inventor component, and the methods of each class correspond to App Inventor component properties or functions.
If you are an App Inventor programmer and want to transition to Java, the App Inventor Java Bridge is for you.</p>
<h2>
Sample Java Bridge Apps
</h2>
</p>
To program with the Java Bridge, import this <a href="http://3nportal.com/AIBridge/AIBridge.jar" >library jar file</a> into your Android 
project (in either Eclipse or Android Studio). 
</p>
<p>Here are some sample apps (Java code):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/javaBridge/clickRed/Screen1.java">ClickRed</a> -- A simple app to demonstrate the form of a Java Bridge app, click a button to turn it red.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/jBridgePaintPot">PaintPot</a> -- Draw on a picture you take with the camera! This app introduces the Canvas component, drawing commands, and variables.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/jBridgeMoleMash">MoleMash</a> -- Click the mole to earn points! This app introduces Canvas, ImageSprite and Clocks timers.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/javaBridge/presidentsQuiz/Screen1.java">President's Quiz</a> -- A trivia app about US Presidents, you can customize to make your own quizzes. Learn about lists and how to index through a list.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/javaBridge/stockMarket/Screen1.java">Stock Market App</a> -- Track your favorite stocks in real-time. Learn about the Web component and APIs.

<h2>Build Your First App: ClickRed</h2>
<p>To introduce you to programming with the Java Bridge library, you&rsquo;ll create a very simple app: when the user clicks on 
a button, it changes color to red (Wahoooooo!). The sample demonstrates the structure you&rsquo;ll need in your code to build 
Android apps with the Java Bridge library. Once you complete this tutorial, you can try any of the above samples using these
"RedClick" instructions.</p>
