<p>
Never coded but want to learn how to build apps? Then you've come
to the right place. This course targets beginners of all ages and
starts at the very beginning--setting up App Inventor. With video and text-based lessons, Professor Wolber will
step you through building progressively more complex apps. You'll learn how to build many types of apps
and you'll learn programming
concepts and terminology.

<p>
Want to provide your students with the motivational experience of App Inventor but don't want
to create curriculum from scratch? The course outline and materials provided here are modeled after 
Professor Wolber's course, "Computing, Mobile Apps, and the Web"
at the University of San Francisco, which he has taught 
since a Google App Inventor pilot in 2009. You are welcome to use the course outline directly,
link to the materials, remix them, and pick and choose modules as you like. Whether you 
are teaching on-line, in-person, or a hybrid "flipped" classroom, the course-in-a-box is for you!
